<p>
    See the the top of the source file for controls.

<p>
    NOTE: although I've tested the algorithm for insert/delete decently well,
    there is quite a bit flickering when the tree is redrawn. Unfortunately,
    the tree is currently redrawn on every input, so if you hold down any key
    it will flicker to no end.
</p>

<p>
    You can try it in the neovim terminal which doesn't suffer the same
    flickering as a native terminal emulator.
