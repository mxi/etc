    <p>
        NOTE: although I've tested the algorithm for insert/delete decently well,
        there is quite a bit flickering when the tree is redrawn. Unfortunately,
        the tree is currently redrawn on every input, so if you hold down any key
        it will flicker to no end.

    <p>
        You can try it in the neovim terminal which doesn't suffer the same
        flickering as a native terminal emulator.
